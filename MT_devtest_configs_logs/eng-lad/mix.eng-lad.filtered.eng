in a very different way, by the 1930s, europe was becoming a very ugly place. by 1939, the second world war had begun, but in this war, turkey managed to stay neutral. only later did i find out the terrible things that were done in europe, and i do know now that when some german jews were fleeing the nazis, they found refuge in turkey. how did any of this affect a small child? after all, i was only four-years-old in 1940. but i do remember them putting up black out blinds in our house, and also, bread and sugar were rationed—although my parents never let me feel that.
