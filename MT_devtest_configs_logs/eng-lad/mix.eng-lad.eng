There were a lot of problems in the world in 2019.
Winter has finally come. Rains, cold, the sky covered with black clouds and finally, snow.
For the children, the best days of winter are when it snows a lot.
When it snows a lot, schools close and the children enjoy a holiday.
It isn't that pleasant for people who have to go to work even when it snows a lot.
The roads close, the traffic is horrendous and it takes people hours to get to and from work.
If you get home safe and sound, you make yourself a coffee and watch the snow from the window.

When I was little, we used to go to Prinkipo (Büyükada) for the summer.
The Marmara sea was one of the best for swimming. It was neither cold nor warm, neither too salty nor to little salty; it was ideal.
The horses of Büyükada were a symbol of the island. There weren't any cars and the air was very clean, without any pollution.
There have been problems with the horses since too many tourists began to arrive at the Island. To earn more money, the carriage owners started to exhaust the horses.
They have now decide to remove the horses from Büyükada. Instead, they will install little electric cars.
Maybe it will be better for the horses but another symbol of our childhood is disappearing. What a pity!
Without its horse carriages, the clean sea, and with so much house construction going on, the Büyükada of 50 years ago is not the same any more.
They have been saying for a few days now that it is going to snow in Istanbul but instead of snow we have sun and blue skies.
A lot of people are sick with the flu in this season. If it snows, the microbes will die.
The population of Istanbul is so great that snow is not possible.
There are a lot of earthquakes in our country these days. There were a lot of deaths and a lot of damage.
We should all be prepared for an earthquake.
We should protect ourselves against microbes in this season by taking lots of vitamins and wearing warm clothes when going out.
On February 16th, we are going to celebrate the 7th Intenational Judeo/Spanish / Ladino Day, in Istanbul.
On February 16th, we have many activites from 11 in the morning until 6 in the evening. All our activities will be in Judeo-Spanish.
On February 16th, in the morning we will have a great professor from Paris, Marie-Christine Varol, who will talk to us about the idioms of mothers-in-law.

After the concert, we have "borekas" and biscuits for tea.
We expect to see yoù all on February the 16th to celebrate this day of Judeo-Spanish with us. We are the only country in the world to organize a whole day of activities in Judeo-Spanish.
If you like theatre, come and see the musical play "REKUERDOS" on February 16th. You will like it a lot.
Last year the Ladino Day play was called "LOS MACHUKADOS" and everyone loved it.
This year Forti Barokas is again the author of the musical "REKUERDOS". Ferit Koen is again the director of the play.
The actors of the musical "REKUERDOS" are from the Dostluk group of actors, who have become "Amigos Para Siempre".
The actors are all amateurs and always come to rehearsals from their jobs tired but are revived during rehearsal.
Every year we say, "This year is the last, I  will not act any more", and yet the moment it is over, we ask Forti, "Are you writing a new play?"
Theatre is like a virus. Once it's in your blood, it does not leave easily.
We expect to have a healthy and happy new year.
One sentence a day
A Little Grammar
There really is no city in the world like Istanbul
We are, after all, in Europe
And in Asia
We are both incredibly modern
And have wonderful traditions
In many ways, Istanbul connects the world –through different cultures
between religions, and 
even in multi ethnic  families
But I’m going to guess you haven’t heard many family stories like mine. 
After all, my parents were born Jewish
But converted to Islam so that means I was born a Muslim, too.
But then I converted to Judaism to get married
And well, that marriage didn’t work out and I married a lovely Muslim man
And when my children were married – they didn't marry Muslims or Jews.
My son-in-law even wears kilts.
So the question is: how could a family be this diverse?  And the answer begins, not here in Istanbul, but in Spain, 500 years ago. 
In August 1492, when Christopher Columbus sailed from the port of Palos westwards, the Jews of Spain—who had lived there for a thousand years-- were being expelled by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.  These Jews became known as the Sephardim, as Sepharad in Hebrew means Spain.
Many of these expelled Jews found a new home on the other side of the Mediterranean –in the lands of the Ottoman sultans.  
They brought with them their traditions,  their style of dress,  and even their language—which we call Ladino, or Judeo Español,
Compared to Christian Europe, the Ottomans were far more tolerant toward Jews in their empire.   In fact, these Sephardic Jews had found a home.  
Here’s where my family fits into all this history. This is Constanza, a city on the Black Sea.  It’s in Romania. 
And this is where my father’s side of the family lived at the beginning of the 20th century.    My grandfather, Izak David Nassi worked in a bank…
…was married and had four children.  The youngest of his children, who was born in 1903, would become my father.
In 1920, my grandfather was transferred to the Istanbul branch of his bank, and that is how my father came to Turkey at the age of seventeen. 
I can trace my mother’s side of the family back even further.  They were also Sephardic Jews and had lived in Çanakkale for generations.  This is my great grandmother, Miryam Levi, who lived to be 96 and who we called Nonika.
She was born in 1847 and died in 1943—and that means she saw the last decades of the Ottoman Empire and the birth of modern Turkey, which was founded by Kemal Atatürk in 1923.   
 My Nonika had one daughter, my grandmother Esther… 
Grandmother, who married a man by the name of Moshe Benezra, had nine children— They went on to become my uncles and aunts. One of her children was Neama, my mother, who was born in 1900—and lived for 97 years.   
In this enormous family of my grandparents, they lived in a modest house in Sirkeci that included all the children as well as Nonika and my grandfather Moshe’s mother, who they called La Señora.  Hmmm, now as you know In the First World War, the Ottoman Empire was an ally of Germany and Austria, and Grandfather Moshe went off to serve in the Ottoman army.  I don’t know where he served, but there were fierce battles between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies, and I know Grandmother Esther never knew when, or if, he would return home.  Just to keep bread on the table, She sewed cloth sacks for an exporter of hazelnuts until finally, the war ended, and Grandfather returned home. 
When the republic was born in 1923, the family celebrated with everyone else on our national holidays.  As a traditional Sephardic family, they celebrated the Jewish holidays, too, like Pesach, when more than 30 people would come to dinner, to listen to my grandfather lead the service, and the family would prepare traditional Sephardic dishes. 
When my mother was a young woman in the late 1920s and 30s, she volunteered as an accountant at the Jewish Hospital in Istanbul.  There she met this very handsome young man when he transferred the accounting books to her.  She liked him a lot, but then—she didn’t see him again.
Then a few months later, right here in Istanbul, there was this rainstorm, and my mother was standing in a doorway.  Suddenly that same good looking man from the hospital showed up – and he was holding an umbrella.   That man was Henri Nassi.  That was the beginning of their courtship, and eventually, Henri and Neama decided to get married.
But it was more complicated than that.  You see, remember I told you my father was Romanian?  He didn’t have Turkish citizenship and he wanted to be Turkish.
And before he and my mother were married, they decided they would take that extra step and convert to Islam.  My dad changed his name to Avni Tunçer, and together, he and my mom visited the Mufti to make the conversion.  
That means when I was born a year later, in 1937, I came into the world as a Muslim.
My father was a hard-working man and before I was born, he had started his own business in aromatic oils.
As a child, I remember he used to come home at night and when he walked in the door, the room was flooded with the scent of roses—or sometimes lemons—it was really wonderful.  In fact, people called him ‘Avni Bey, the King of Aromatic oils.’
Now Istanbul when I was growing up was one of the most magical and beautiful cities in the world—a jewel along the Bosphorus,  -- filled with  great architecture from the Roman and Byzantine times, when it was called Constantinople-- --through the centuries of the Ottomans.    
In a very different way, by the 1930s, Europe was becoming a very ugly place. By 1939, the Second World War had begun, but in this war, Turkey managed to stay neutral. Only later did I find out the terrible things that were done in Europe, and I do know now that when some German Jews were fleeing the Nazis, they found refuge in Turkey. How did any of this affect a small child?  After all, I was only four-years-old in 1940.  But I do remember them putting up black out blinds in our house, and also, bread and sugar were rationed—although my parents never let me feel that.  
My father, like so many other men, was conscripted into the army when the war started.  No one knew what was really going to happen.  Would Turkey join in the war?   If so, on whose side?   Many non-Muslim families were financially ruined during the war by what they called a Wealth Tax.  My father was affected too, but since he had converted to Islam many years before, not as badly as others in our family.   Turkey did remain neutral during the war, and when my father returned home, he started to rebuild his business after 1945.   
But five years later, he fell ill with a horrid case of meningitis. The doctors told him he wasn’t going to live.
But when he came out of his coma, he whispered to them:  ‘I can’t die, I have a daughter to marry off.” 
Not long after that, I met Ceki Karasu.  He was Jewish and he was a student in university.  Ceki and I decided to get married.  But since he was Jewish and I had been born a Muslim, and since we both wanted to get married in a synagogue, I went through the process of converting to Judaism.    First, I went to see the Mufti, and he asked: “Have you thought it over carefully?  I said that this was what I wanted. Then I went to the Grand Rabbinate, where I went through the process of becoming Jewish 
and we were married in the Neve Shalom Synagogue in 1954.    After a few years, Ceki and I started to grow apart:  He wanted to continue his studies in the United States, but
I wanted to stay in Turkey. And so…  … we parted.
After my divorce, I started working for my dad. And I am proud to say that I became one of the first women sales representatives in Turkey—and traveled all over Europe throughout the 1960s.  
In my leisure time, I went horseback riding, and through a friend, I met Günel Orgun, a lovely Muslim man, and what a typical Turk he was—blonde hair and beautiful green eyes!    And this time, I knew I had found the right man.   
In November 1965, we were  married –  not in a traditional Muslim way, and  not in a synagogue,    but a civil ceremony—Günel would remain a Muslim and I would remain Jewish. 
Our son Orhan was born in 1966 and two years later, 
we had our daughter—Gün.  
As we raised our family, we lived in Istanbul and even on a farm.  
But just because my children grew up on a farm doesn’t mean they didn’t study hard.  In fact, I’m proud to say that they both earned their doctorate degrees— Orhan in Linguistics  And Gün received her doctorate in English literature.

At the end of the 15th century, the Sephardic Jews who were forced to leave Spain by the Spanish Inquisition, took with them their musical culture and blended it with the cultures of the places they arrived at, thus enriching it.
That is why, the original Sephardic music opened itself up to the various musical influences of the new countries it found itself in and added the new and popular elements to its traditional form.
This is how the Tango was added to the Sephardic music.
In order to specify the place the Tango holds in the Sephardic music, we have to remind ourselves of the three basic forms that exist in the Sephardic poetry-music: Romansas, Koplas and Kantikas.
When we look at these genres, we see that the Tango does not fit any of them; maybe that is why we can classify it as “marginal”.
However, even though they may be classified as marginal, the place of the Tango in Sephardic music has been anything but marginal.
Shoshana Weich-Shahak tells us of the important place the Tango holds in the repertoires of her subjects, from whom she has collected songs for many years.
These subjects, most often than not, did not know the origins of the songs in their memories and would sometimes even believe that these songs came from Spain.
In relation to other genres of Sephardic music, the advantage that the Tangos have is that we are able to figure out exactly when they were composed.
It is important to note the following from the beginning: Sephardic tangos have adapted pre-existing tangos to their taste, have written lyrics in Judeo-Spanish over existing melodies or have directly translated them.
We can see the following features in the adaptations of the Tangos:
Remaining faithful to the original lyrics as much as possible.
The differences stem from faulty memory or from the fact that the original meanings were not fully understood.
Partial translations of the original text.
Judeo-Spanish speakers’ not fully understanding the text leads to the lyrics being changed with those that can be understood.
Borrowing of popular melodies and re-writing lyrics in Judeo-Spanish.
This tradition is so common in Sephardic music that it is hardly surprising.
The new lyrics for these songs also include themes of the pains of love but they also reflect the everyday lives of the Jewish community: criticism of social practices, problems in family relationships, changes in the mode of life, new fashions, etc.
The Tango has been adopted by the Sephardim as a very popular part of the Turkish Sephardic music tradition.
Alongside original compositions, it was a widespread tradition to write lyrics in Judeo-Espanyol on popular melodies.
The group Los Pasharos Sefaradis in this new CD of theirs called “\ Tangos Sefaradis del Dip del Baul\ ” have included Necip Celal Andel's first Turkish tango, Greek tangos with Sadik and Gazoz lyrics and also contemporary new compositions, which they hope will please their audiences.
DOCUMENTARY ON TURKISH JEWISH THEATRE
Film director, Aksel Bonfil has been chosen to make this documentary.
The project manager and at the same time owner of the archive is Izzet Bana & the editor is Emel Benbasat.
The main content of the project will be about the process and development of the amateur and professional theatre in the Turkish Jewish Community both before and after the Republic and its effects on the said community.
The effect of the theatrical activities on the major (Turkish) culture will also be incuded in the documentary.
Taking these points into consideration, three locations will be important for the project: Istanbul, Izmir and Israel.
The members of the producing institutions, the theatrical directors, the playwrights and the actors will be interviewed.
The documentary will include what happens behind the scenes and how the plays meet the audience with scenes getting the details from the archive and present day activities.
The maximum time span to realize the project is 5 months.
The objectives during this time span are: getting the audio recordings of the interviews, finalizing the shooting of the film, the editing, audio mixing, color arrangements and subtitles, and getting the film ready to be presented to its audience.
The aim of the project is to develop a memory of the Turkish Jewish Theatre and leave an archive to future generations so they can continue the work.
We also aim to show the film in locations where members of the major culture will also be able to watch it.

 SEPHARDIC TANGOS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CHEST
In the year 2010, during the "Confarad" conference I attended in Rio de Janeiro, my good friend, Liliana Benveniste, sang some famous Argentinian tangos with Judeo-Spanish lyrics during her concert ay the conference.
I loved listening to those beautiful melodies in Judeo-Espanyol. So when I returned home, I wrote to all my musicologist and ethnomusicologist friends to ask them if they knew of any tangos with Judeo-Espanyol lyrics.
Prof. Susana Weich-Shahak, Prof. Edwin Seroussi, Rivka Havassy, Moshe Shaul, Matilda Koen-Sarano, Flory Jagoda, Ramon Tasat and Betty Klein sent me the tangos they knew of and articles on sephardic tangos.
Thanks to them all, I learned a lot on a subject I had known nothing about.
I then thought it would be a good idea to make a CD on Sephardic Tangos, something that had not been done before.
Instead of famous Argentinian tangos, we decided to make a CD with songs from the east, from our lands, from the Balkans, songs that were nearly forgotten.
We even included the first Turkish tango, Necip Celal Andel's "Mazi" tango with Judeo-Espanyol lyrics, “Tu Memoria es una Lagrima”.
In this way we continued the long tradition of Los Pasharos Sefaradis.
We also wanted to include original tangos to the repertoire so our friends Alper Almelek, Betty Klein, Avraham Reuveni and Ceyda Pirali presented us with their compositions.
After long and arduous months of work, our CD is finally ready.
I would like to thank first of all the wonderful young talent, our maestro Ceyda Pirali for her great work in the production of the CD, then my friend of 40-years, co-founder of Los Pasharos Sefaradis, Izzet Bana and all the other musicians for their contributions in the CD.
We are really happy that we have been able to unearth these great songs from the dark corners they were residing in.
We hope you will love them as much as we do.

Los Pasharos Sefaradis' new album has appeared!
Los Pasharos Sefaradis' new album, "Tangos Sefaradis del Dip del Baul" is finally out for sale.
We are very proud to have published a CD full of sephardic tangos, the first of its kind in the world.
This has been arduous work, which was the result of a lot of investigation, cooperation with friends around the world and contribution of a lot of academicians, musicologists and ethnomusicologists.
Tangos in Salonika
Rivka Havassy =============
These songs belong to a genre called Kantes populares, which flourished between the two World Wars, especially in Salonika.
Kantes populares combined original texts in Ladino with melodies of contemporary popular songs, mainly Greek, French and South American.
The majority of these melodies were dance music, the tango being one of the most popular.
Moshe Cazes (“Gazoz”) was a journalist and editor who wrote articles, humorous series and songs.
He worked as an organizer of family gatherings and events, where in addition to catering he also entertained the guests, singing songs that he composed.
Sadik Gershon was a blind musician who directed synagogue choirs, and composed liturgical music.
He played the ud and had a small orchestra in the Turkish style (Chalgi).
Sadik and Gazoz’s songs were performed by the authors and by other amateur musicians and singers.
The songs were also printed in humoristic newspapers or in booklets that appeared from time to time.
Many of the Kantes populares became part of the oral Sephardic tradition, among them Syente mi korason and Florika la servidera.
Some of them, such as No me importa and El vino i la mujer, enjoy a revival in recent years.
They are recorded here for the first time, combining the Greek tango melodies with texts found in Ladino song booklets from Salonika.
Sadik and Gazoz perished in the Holocaust, together with many members of the Salonika Jewish community.
ENGLISH:
Meatballs in Tomato Sauce
Ingredients:
500 gr minced meat
4 slices of stale bread
1 egg
pepper
1 teaspoonful of salt
For the Sauce:
6 big tomatoes or 5 tablespoon of tomato paste
1 glass of water
To Fry:
1 cup of olive oil or sunflower oil
Directions:
Mix the materials to make the meatballs and knead well.
Make big and round meatballs.
Heat half a cup of oil on high heat for a minute.
In a deep pan start to prepare the sauce.
Put the fried meatballs in the sauce prepared with tomatoes or tomato paste.
To give the meatballs its taste, cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.
Note: Those who do not like fried food can cook the meatballs directly in the tomato sauce that is boiling.
Notes from the Producer: 
When I first listened and examined the repertoire, they were all traditional and classical tangos that had roamed the generations through long years.
In some of the versions, there were even some modifications in the unit measurements of the melodies.
I had to do something different.
The listeners had to hear something different from the familiar sound of the original song in their ears and they also had to be surprised along the way.
What I had to do had to be original as I would put my name under it and the album also had to be far away from being monotonous.
On the other hand, whatever I did had to be done without harming the nostalgic, traditional and original makeup and soul of the songs themselves.
Before starting the arrangements, I preferred to make small changes in the forms of the songs.
Sometimes I got away from the classical tango rhythm.
Some of the tangos left their places to Bossanova or Bolero or even a Ballad.
Some of them could only be Tango\ s and did not allow for any changes.
After deciding on the forms, it was time to make decisions over the instruments to be used in the album.
As I believe in the universality of music and also because the album would be released from Turkey, I decided to also use Turkish instruments like the ud, the kanun, the tanbur and the clarinet.
This decision was also parallel to the specific and very much liked east-west synthesis sound that has characterized Los Pasharos Sefaradis through the years.
As a result, we have a new album that will be listened to by many generations to come, an album with a very distinguished taste.
I hope everyone enjoys what we got great pleasure in the making.

Sephardic Humor
Humor is a very special characteristic of cultures and languages and contains in its essence, their lives, their wishes, their pain, their loves and their laughs.
Sephardic humor is very specific because the Sephardim know how to laugh at themselves, which is something that is not easily found in many communities.
The typical Sephardi, man or woman, anecdotes, proverbs, idioms, humoristic or absurd songs: all of these will give us a good idea of what Sephardic humor is, especially the humor of the Sephardim of the Ottoman Empire.
This cultural heritage shows us how the Jews used to live in the past and what they laughed at.
We will have the opportunity to see that humor actually transcends time and that there is a universal kind of humor that is understood by all and that makes all laugh.
We are happy when we laugh.
So, let's laugh a little!

Edirne, as a city, has a 500 years old Sephardic Jewish past, a unique Sephardic culture, traditions and music.
It would have been impossible not to have a unique Sephardic cuisine in such a city.
Researchers Aydemir Ay and Dr. Yılmaz Seçim have succeeded in bringing out this cuisine, which was in danger of disappearing completely, to the light of day.
They collected very valuable information from ladies and gentlemen born and raised in Edirne using the field research and oral history techniques.
The Municipality of Edirne was instrumental in publishing the book in three languages.
Cultural interaction exists among all societies who live together.
All social and ethnic groups get influenced by their neighbors and borrow the cultural elements like traditions, tastes (cuisine) and melodies fitting them into their own cultural and religious framework.
This is what the 500-year-old Ottoman/Turkish Sephardic culture is like.
The Maftirim music, which was born in Edirne is very similar to the Edirne Sufi music.
The Edirne food recipes make a point of using Edirne cheeses.
We also see mutual interaction in traditions.
Let us know take a look at Ladino, a language that is slowly disappearing.
The language of the Sephardic Jews, Judeo-Espanyol/Ladino, an Ottoman language, was born in the Ottoman Empire and is slowly disappearing in these lands.
The Sephardic Jews, who were expulsed from Spain by the Spanish Inquisition were received by the Ottoman Empire and when they first settled there, they preferred to be with the citizens of the region they came from.
When their population increased, they had no choice but to live with members of other communities.
The Spanish Jews came from all the different regions of the Iberian peninsula and thus spoke the different dialects spoken in the places they came from.
All these dialects intermingled in the big cauldron of the Ottoman Empire, giving birth to Judeo-Spanish/Ladino.
The kingdom of Castille, being the largest reign at the time, it follows that Castiliano became the basis of Ladino with influences from all the other dialects forming the dough that created Ladino.
With such a connection, it was necessary that the book, "Edirne Sephardic Jewish Cuisine", be translated into Ladino as well.
The researchers of the book asked for help on the subject from the Sephardic Center of Istanbul and a member of the Center, Forti Barokas undertook the task.
This book is valuable for many reasons.
First of all, it should be noted that there is not a Jewish population in Edirne any more.
That is why our researchers found people who were born and raised in Edirne and who still remembered the food recipes.
They then learned to make the recipes so well that they were able to take excellent photos of the dishes to include in the book.
They deserve our sincere congratulations.
What is more, the fact that the book was translated into Ladino is also very important.
In order to translate specific culinary words correctly, the members of our Center helped by trying to remember the cooking vocabulary of their mothers and grandmothers.
We were even able to create a lexicon thanks to their efforts.
That is why, the book has become invaluable.
It is extremely important to preserve our cultural inheritance and thus transmit it to future generations so that they can learn where they come from and their history.
This is crucial for them to preserve their ethnic identity.
If our young people know where they come from, they can also easily know where to go.
We are very grateful to our researchers, Aydemir Ay and Dr. Yılmaz Seçim for their contribution to our cultural inheritance.

Los Pasharos Sefaradis was first founded in 1978 and the group’s first cassette recording was done during one of their concerts at BILSAK in spite of all the inconveniences and difficulties.
This was the first Turkish-Sephardic music recording ever done in Turkey, and this three cassette-recording contained the most beautiful and widely-known examples of this kind of music.
The cassettes sold out three times over but the demand and interest to these songs and the music never diminished.
In 2002, we released our “Zemirot” CD, which was prepared with the contributions of master musicians in their instruments.
The great success of “Zemirot” showed us that we should raise the level of the quality even more in this new CD we were preparing.
So we decided to try out a new concept in this CD you are holding.
We tried to interpret our songs by going through the doors that open to the west (LA PUERTA AL OKSIDENTE) and to the east (LA PUERTA AL ORIENTE) from our city, Istanbul, where the world cultures meet.
We would like to express our gratitude to Gözlem Gazetecilik in the person of Mr. Silvyo Ovadya, whose continual support has enabled us to to make the richness and universality of the Turkish-Sephardic music available to all.
The Jews of Edirne have a long history and presence in that city.
The Municipality of Edirne has published 3 versions of the same book in 3 different languages (Turkish, English, Judeo-Spanish/Ladino) to reach a wider audience.
The book was translated and edited by Karen Gerson Sarhon.
This wonderful book can be obtained at: www.istanbulsephardiccenter.com
The delicious recipes of Edirne await your pleasure and will stimulate your tastebuds!
El Amaneser is the only newspaper in the world to be published entirely in the Judeo-Espanyol language.
It is published once a month as the supplement of Şalom, the only newspaper of the Turkish-Jewish community.
